It is essential that you verify the integrity of the downloaded files using the PGP and SHA512 signatures.
Please read [Verifying Apache HTTP Server Releases](https://httpd.apache.org/dev/verification.html) for more
information on why you should verify our releases.

The PGP signatures can be verified using PGP or GPG. First download the
[KEYS](https://www.apache.org/dist/logging/KEYS) as well as the asc signature file for the relevant distribution.
Make sure you get these files from the [main distribution directory](https://www.apache.org/dist/logging/), rather
than from a mirror. Then verify the signatures using

    gpg --import KEYS
    gpg --verify apache-log4j-${Log4jReleaseVersion}-bin.tar.gz.asc

Apache Log4j ${Log4jReleaseVersion} is signed by ${Log4jReleaseManager} (${Log4jReleaseKey})

Alternatively, you can verify the SHA512 signature on the files. A unix program called sha or sha512sum is included
in many unix distributions.

$h2 Previous Releases

Log4j 2.12.1 was the last 2.x release to support Java 7 while Log4j 2.3 was the last 2.x release to support
Java 6. The Log4j team no longer provides support for Java 6 or 7.

All previous releases of Apache log4j can be found in the
[ASF archive repository](https://archive.apache.org/dist/logging/log4j/). Of course, all releases are availble for
use as dependencies from the [Maven Central Repository](https://search.maven.org/search?q=org.apache.logging.log4j)

$h2 Using Log4j on your classpath

To use Log4j 2 in your application make sure that both the API and Core jars are in the application's classpath. Add
the dependencies listed below to your classpath.

    log4j-api-${Log4jReleaseVersion}.jar
    log4j-core-${Log4jReleaseVersion}.jar

You can do this from the command line or a manifest file.
